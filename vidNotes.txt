git notes

How To Start:
-solidify your SCHEMA set up for each table
-set up the DB migration model and seeders (dont have to make that many seeders they are just testers)

-work on Kanban

- TEST FREQUENTLY constantly test between coding so you will know what lines of code cause an error
if you wait too long it will be hard to finf
